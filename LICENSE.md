## Preamble
The Aetheric General License exists to preserve the integrity, openness, and creative sovereignty of Aetheric systems, Baatorian works, and derivative projects.  
It grants freedom to use, modify, and redistribute code, data, lore, and simulation frameworks, provided that such freedom is preserved in all derivative or combined works.

This license was created for ecosystems that blend infrastructure, simulation, and narrative. It protects the creator’s authorship while ensuring the shared universe remains accessible to others who contribute in good faith.
