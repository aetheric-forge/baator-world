# baator v0.4 model (reconstructed)

This is a reconstructed, standalone scaffold of the v0.4 branch focused on the kernel/DDD surface and TUI entrypoint.
It includes:
- a `kernel` package with DDD primitives and an event bus with adapter plugs
- placeholders for `domain`, `interface`, and `runtime`
- a minimal `dm_tui` entrypoint

The goal: provide a typed, import-ready foundation you can extend. This is intentionally lightweight and adapter-friendly.
